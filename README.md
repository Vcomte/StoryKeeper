			Welcome to this Story Keeper demo

Story keeper is a game developed as an End of year project for the 
IDE Master at ENJMIN/Gobelins between January 2017 and May 2017.

Disclaimer:
			The project has been developed with Unity3D vers 5.5.0f3

Concept:	
			Story Keeper is a 3D mobile Narrative adventure game,
			where the player will follow the adventures of William,
			a young man living in the 2020s. As William begins a new
			job at the General Archives, he will discover that magic
			and technology are being used by a Secret Society to 
			capture knowledge and power coming from the greatest
			literary works of our time. William will embark upon an
			adventure inside the stories of these literary works to
			save the knowledge and freedom of Mankind, as well as 
			answering questions about his grand-father's disapearance.
			
			The player will be able to discover multiple literary works
			throughout the game: The Odyssey, The Cid, Thousand Leagues
			Under the Sea, and many more. As he progresses through these
			stories, the main plot will evolve, and the adventures of 
			William will take all their meaning.
			
			As well as providing a fun narrative experience, Story Keeper
			invites the player to take a new look on the classical literary
			works by providing extracts from the books, as well as
			interesting facts on the authors and on the influence these
			literary works have had on our culture.
			
Instructions:
			This demo of the game will let you discover the very begining
			of William's adventures inside the Odyssey of Homere. This demo
			was developed for recent Android Devices (both Tablet and
			smartphones). You are free to build a version to your IOs device
			by using Unity.
			A version for lower end devices will be developed later.
